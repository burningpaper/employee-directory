You are extracting structured job history from a screenshot of a LinkedIn profile.

Rules:
- Only include entries that are clearly listed under the 'Experience' section.
- Each entry must contain:
  - company
  - role
  - location (if visible)
  - start_date (e.g., Apr 2020)
  - end_date (e.g., Feb 2023 or "Present")
  - description (full, with newlines as \n)

Strict instructions:
- Do NOT guess missing entries based on similar text blocks or formatting.
- If you cannot see a field clearly, leave it as an empty string.
- Do NOT add companies or job titles that do not appear *under the experience section*.
- Only extract experience entries that have visible start and end dates.
- Format as JSON array, example:

[
  {
    "company": "VML South Africa",
    "role": "Chief Strategy Officer",
    "location": "Johannesburg, South Africa",
    "start_date": "Feb 2024",
    "end_date": "Present",
    "description": "VML&R Parusha Partha: Challenging the commonplace notion of strategy..."
  },
  ...
]
