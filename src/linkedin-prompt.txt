You will be given a **screenshot of a LinkedIn profile’s Experience section**.  
Your task is to extract the **work experience data** with extreme accuracy.  

❗️Only include actual **roles the person held** at official **employers**, as listed in the **main job header section** (usually bold and top-aligned).  

⚠️ Ignore any brands or companies mentioned in descriptions as:  
- Clients  
- Brand portfolios  
- Projects  
- Collaborators  
- Speaking engagements or boards  

Do not hallucinate or infer missing jobs.  

Output a **clean JSON array** in the following format:

[
  {
    "company": "Company Name",
    "role": "Job Title",
    "start": "Apr 2022",
    "end": "Present",
    "description": "Short summary of what the person did in this role, exactly as it appears"
  },
  {
    "company": "Next Company",
    "role": "Another Title",
    "start": "Jan 2020",
    "end": "Mar 2022",
    "description": "..."
  }
]

Notes:
- If a company appears more than once with different roles, include each as a separate object with correct dates.
- Use the date format "MMM YYYY" (e.g., "Jun 2019").
- If an end date is not listed, use "Present".
- Preserve formatting and paragraph structure from the description.
- Never fabricate roles or fill in missing data from context — only extract what's visible.
- If multiple roles are grouped under one company (as is often done on LinkedIn), extract each role separately using the respective title and date range.

⚠️ The extraction should be surgical, accurate, and **based only on what is visually present in the screenshot**.
